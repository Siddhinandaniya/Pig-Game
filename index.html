      On a turn, a player rolls the die ðŸŽ² repeatedly. The goal is to accumulate
      as many points as possible, adding up (hold) the numbers rolled on the die
      ðŸŽ². However, if a player rolls a <span class="number">1</span>, the
      player's turn is over and any points they have accumulated during this
      turn are forfeited. Rolling a <span class="number">1</span> doesn't wipe
      out your entire score from previous turns, just the total earned during
      that particular roll. A player has to choose to hold (stop rolling the die
      ðŸŽ²) if they do not want to take a chance of rolling a
      <span class="number">1</span> and losing all of their points from this
      turn. If the player chooses to hold, all of the points rolled during that
      turn are added to his or her score. When a player reaches a total of
      <span class="number">100</span> points, the game ends and that player is
      the winner.
